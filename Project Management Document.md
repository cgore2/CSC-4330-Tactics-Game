###1. Introduction
####1.1. Purpose
Team [SDCM] shall develop a tactical game based for the Windows pc. This project shall undergo a full project life-cycle, including gameplay testing. The game shall consist of player elements (Dolphins) and conflict elements (Sharks) that involve high-strategy and tactical decision making in a turn-based environment. Players shall be able to make decisions which effect gameplay in such a way that proper decisions shall lead to victory in the game. The game may include both computer vs player and player vs player gameplay, but not necessarily both. The game shall be called Sub-Dolphin Machine Cannon, or SDMC, which shares an acronym with the team name SDMC or Software Develop Machine Creation.

####1.2. Intended Audience
The following document is intended for reading for team members, LSU CSC students and LSU CSC staff. The document is organized around user experience development.

####1.3. Scope
Sub-Dolphin Machine is based on turn based tactical full-awareness games in the vein of chess and Square Enix’s Final Fantasy Tactics Advance as well as other games within the genre. The games main artistic contribution to the genre is the addition of armed dolphins. The game will involve deep turn based strategy and player advancement as well as the ability to control the in-game avatars, which will be dolphins with cannons on them. The player will progress through different levels of the game, level up, and unlock new items for customization along the way.

####1.4. Design summary
At this point in time the game Sub dolphin machine cannon has been defined as a turn based tactical game meant for windows users. Keeping this in mind the users should be able to easily access and play the game. The game is made unique by its implementation of dolphins in a turn based strategy genre. Further more the game offers the user the fun option to use more than just one type of unit but rather multiple battle units. This document will be outlining the conceptual and technical sides of the games design for increased understanding of the pre game maneuvering and in game play. The game will be based on object-oriented architecture, and will be able to easily add future levels in new releases of the game. Using this approach means that the system can change easily, but over all will remain more or less static. 

###2. Objectives
####2.1. Interface Objectives
The game interface has the highest design priority. The interface will involve selected movements and player involvement as well as the tactical structure for the game. The game interface will include the menu interface, the play interface, the tactical planning interface and the system options interface. These interfaces will be the main way that the player interacts with the game. 

####2.2. Quality Attributes
Robustness: In multiplayer, if users lose connection to each other. The system shall save the game and enable the users to reconnect to the game, once connection has been restored.
Portability: The game will not require internet connection, allowing for more portability with less gameplay constraints.
Usability: The games UI’s will be very easy to navigate, and the actual gameplay will be very straightforward. Yet, it will still allow for very strategic gameplay.
Availability: Users with the proper devices to access the game will have access at all times.
