###1. Introduction
####i. Purpose
Team [SDCM] shall develop a tactical game based for the Windows pc. This project shall undergo a full project life-cycle, including gameplay testing. The game shall consist of player elements (Dolphins) and conflict elements (Sharks) that involve high-strategy and tactical decision making in a turn-based environment. Players shall be able to make decisions which effect gameplay in such a way that proper decisions shall lead to victory in the game. The game may include both computer vs player and player vs player gameplay, but not necessarily both. The game shall be called Sub-Dolphin Machine Cannon, or SDMC, which shares an acronym with the team name SDMC or Software Develop Machine Creation.

####ii. Intended Audience
The following document is intended for reading for team members, LSU CSC students and LSU CSC staff. The document is organized around user experience development.
####iii. Scope
Sub-Dolphin Machine is based on turn based tactical full-awareness games in the vein of chess and Square Enixâ€™s Final Fantasy Tactics Advance as well as other games within the genre. The games main artistic contribution to the genre is the addition of armed dolphins. The game will involve deep turn based strategy and player advancement as well as the ability to control the in-game avatars, which will be dolphins with cannons on them. The player will progress through different levels of the game, level up, and unlock new items for customization along the way.
